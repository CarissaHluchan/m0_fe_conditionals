//## Mild
// Write a JavaScript program that defines a variable that stores a Number.
// The program should print out the String "even" if the Number is even,
// and the String "odd" if the Number is odd. 
// Hint: You may need to do some extra research on the 
// remainder operator (%) to solve this challenge.

var age = 36;

if (age % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(age + " is even");
} else {
    console.log(n + " is odd");
}
